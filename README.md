### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (I learned how to test an application by comparing it to an previously published well working application.)
2. (I learned how to edit code so that it corresponds to a particular category. In ths case it was code specific to that of who is filing for their taxes.)
3. (I learned how to troubleshot my problems. If one things goes wrong it is probably because of a simple error. I learned how to easily identify these errors in order to create a successful application.For example on Task 4 I referenced my Lesson 4 file to see how to properly write my code to clear my result.)
